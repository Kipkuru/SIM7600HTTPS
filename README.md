**SIM7600HTTPS Library**
A lightweight Arduino library for the SIM7600 module to handle modem initialization, GPRS connection, and HTTP operations (GET/POST). Designed for reliable, step-by-step setup and periodic HTTP requests.

**Features**
Modem Setup: Initializes SIM7600 with AT commands, SIM check, and signal quality.
GPRS Connection: Configures network registration, LTE mode, and IP assignment with a customizable APN.
HTTP Support: Initializes HTTP sessions and sends POST requests (GET to be added).
Debug Toggle: Optional AT command/response dumping via DumpAtCommands macro.
Installation
Download: Clone or download this repository from GitHub.
Place in Libraries: Move the SIM7600HTTPS folder to your Arduino libraries directory (e.g., ~/Arduino/libraries/SIM7600HTTPS).
Include: Use #include <SIM7600HTTPS.h> in your .ino.
Usage

**Key Functions**
bool init(): Checks modem readiness (AT, SIM, signal)—returns true if successful.
bool gprsConnect(const char* apn): Sets up GPRS with specified APN—returns true if IP assigned.
bool httpInit(const char* server): Initializes HTTP session—returns true if successful.
bool httpPostData(const char* resource, const char* data): Sends HTTP POST—returns true if successful.
void httpTerm(): Terminates HTTP session (optional, call on shutdown).
**Debugging**
Enable AT Commands: Define #define DumpAtCommands in .ino before #include <SIM7600HTTPS.h> to print commands/responses.
Default: Without DumpAtCommands, prints simplified status (e.g., "SIM card ready").
**Dependencies**
Arduino core (<Arduino.h>).
SIM7600 module connected to a serial port (e.g., Serial1).
**Collaboration**
Contributing: Fork, edit .h/.cpp in VS Code, test in Arduino IDE, and submit pull requests via GitHub Desktop.
Issues: Report bugs or suggest features in GitHub Issues.
Lead: GSM code maintained by [your name]—focus on modem/GPRS/HTTP reliability.
